# SNHU-CS255-T2792-System-Analysis-and-Design 

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
The client for this particular project was DriverPass. The project was to design an online application for people to study for their driving exams. Some of the system requirements included online classes, online tests, in-person driving scheduling, accessible on desktop and mobile devices, and the ability to stay up to date with the DMV.   

What did you do particularly well? 
I was able to read the interview document and extract the system requirements from it. I think extracting all the system requirements from the start is essential. If you miss even one requirement it may cause big problems later. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
I will revise my Business Requirements Document. I would improve it by adding a rationale section at the end of each category. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
By reading the DriverPass Intervew Transcript document and understanding the client's requirements and vision for the system the user's needs can be deduced. Of course, you never really know all the user's needs until actual users start using the application.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
Software must begin with an idea or vision for how the software will fulfill some need. Once you have this concept you can begin to brainstorm the system requirements required to make it happen. Certain techniques such as creating a business requirements document, system design document, and creating UML diagrams can help to keep a development team and the client on the same page to achieve the overall vision. Going forward, I would use these documents to help analyze and design future systems.
